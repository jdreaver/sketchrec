==========

This repository holds the codebase I used as a researcher at UC
Riverside. My research revolved around digital handwritten sketch
understanding; we make computers understand what you write. More
particularly, I worked on hierarchically clustering training data to
reduce the recognition time of a new symbol, and large-scale stroke
grouping and identification of GB's of data at one time.
